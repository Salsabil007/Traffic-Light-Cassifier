# Traffic-Light-Cassifier
It is a python code to classify images to detect red, green and yellow signal in a self driving car using Machine Learning classification. 
My target was to reach at least 95% accuracy and never to detect a red signal as green or yellow. Mt program has an
accuracy of 95.95%. I built it as my final project in Udacity Intro to self Driving Car Nanodegree. Hope it will help you.

////// .ipynb files sometimes behave strange. They don't open and show, " something went wrong. Reload? " 
Opening the file in new tap most of the time solves the problem. 
again, you can try this links to solve the problem:
