# Traffic-Light-Cassifier
It is a simple python code to classify images to detect red, green and yellow signal in a self driving car. 
My target was to reach at least 95% accuracy and never to detect a red signal as green or yellow. Mt program has an
accuracy of 95.95%. I built it as my final project in Udacity Intro to self Driving Car Nanodegree. Hope it will help you.
